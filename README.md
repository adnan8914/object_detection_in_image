# object_detection_in_image
1. project based on Machine Learning ,deep learning, artiificial intelligence.
2. Used pascal voc 2012 Dataset .
3. performed model training on only 500 files to execute faster training process.
4. succesfully built state of the art faster R-CNN model to detect object in image.
